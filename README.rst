**O365-notifications** is a *pythonic* implementation for the Notification services
from Office 365. There are currently 2 ways for receiving notifications:

* `Push Notifications <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/
  office-365-api/api/beta/notify-rest-operations-beta>`_
* `Stream Notifications <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/
  office-365-api/api/beta/notify-streaming-rest-operations>`_

The versions on these are beta. For more details, see its documentation.

This approach is built on top of the current `O365 <https://github.com/O365/python-o365
>`_ package. You are recommended to look into its documentation for advance setups.

Notification strategies
=======================
As mentioned, there currently 2 supported notification types in *O365*: **push** and
**streaming**.

As of now, this project relies on *Outlook REST Beta API*. But because this API is
now deprecated and will be decommissioned, a transition to *Microsoft Graph API* is
required. See `this <Important-note-⚠️>`_ section for more details.

Push notifications
------------------
This project does not contain an implementation for this type of notification.
Therefore, contributions are more than welcome.

*O365* documentation on push notifications can be found `here
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/beta/
notify-rest-operations-beta>`_.

Streaming notifications
-----------------------
This project provides an implementation for this type of notification. A quick example
on how to use it is found below:

.. code-block:: python

    import O365
    import O365_notifications.base as base
    import O365_notifications.streaming.mailbox as ms

    account = O365.Account(...)
    mailbox = account.mailbox()

    # mailbox streaming for email creation events
    mn = ms.O365MailBoxStreamingNotifications(
        parent=mailbox, change_type=base.O365Notification.ChangeType.CREATED.value
    )

    # get an inbox folder events subscription
    subscription = mn.subscribe(resource=mailbox.inbox_folder())

    # use default handler which simply logs out the arriving events
    mn.create_event_channel(subscriptions=subscription)

O365 documentation on streaming notifications can be found `here
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/beta/
notify-streaming-rest-operations>`_.

Important note ⚠️
==============
As communicated by *Microsoft* `here <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/
blogs/outlook-rest-api-v2-0-deprecation-notice>`_, The ``v2.0`` REST endpoint will be
fully decommissioned in November 2022, and the ``v2.0`` documentation will be removed
shortly after.

What does it mean to this package?
----------------------------------
Let's see what it means for each one of the notification types:

Push notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Push notifications will be moved to *Microsoft Graph*, and go under the name of
**change notifications**. Its documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/webhooks?view=graph-rest-1.0)>`_.

Transitioning to the *Microsoft Graph* should be a simple and straightforward task.

Streaming notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unfortunately *Microsoft* will not port this service to *Microsoft Graph*. Therefore, as
of November 2022, the current implementation in this project will be obsolete. More
details on that can be found `here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/
compare-graph>`_.
